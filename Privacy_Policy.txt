PRIVACY POLICY FOR KLYVE
Version 1.1 (Open Source) | Last Updated: 28 February 2026

1. THE "LOCAL-FIRST" PROMISE
I, Mario J. Lewis ("Developer"), believe your code and project data belong entirely to you. Klyve is designed as a Local-First application, ensuring that:

No Cloud Storage: The Developer does not operate any cloud servers to upload, store, or monitor your project source code, specifications, or planning documents.

Local Processing: All file generation, database management, and logic processing occur locally on your machine.

Direct Connection: When AI features are used, the Software connects directly from your machine to the AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) using the API key you provide. Your data does not pass through any server owned or operated by the Developer.

2. DATA MINIMALISM
Since the Software runs locally, data collection is non-existent to minimal:

No Telemetry: This version of the Software does not collect usage data, tracking metrics, or background telemetry.

Crash Reports: If you voluntarily submit a bug report via email or the repository, the Developer receives only the data you choose to include (e.g., logs, screenshots).

Website Data: Accessing the Klyve website or GitHub repository results in standard web server logs (IP address, browser type) collected by the hosting provider for security and download tracking.

Transparency Metadata: To comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., EU AI Act), machine-readable metadata indicating that files are AI-generated may be embedded within created files. This metadata does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).

3. THIRD-PARTY AI PROVIDERS
The Software functions by transmitting data to third-party Large Language Model (LLM) providers based on your configuration.

Data Transmitted: Code snippets, file structures, and documentation from your active project are sent to the provider you select.

Model Training: The Developer does not access or store this data and cannot use it to train or fine-tune proprietary models.

Provider Policies: Whether a third-party provider uses your data for training depends on your specific agreement and API tier with them. You are responsible for reviewing the data usage policies of providers like OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic.

API Keys: Your API keys are stored locally in an encrypted database on your machine. The Developer cannot access or revoke them.

4. YOUR DATA RIGHTS
Because the Developer does not store your personal project data, "Right to Access" or "Right to Delete" requests do not apply to the Developer's infrastructure.

Project Control: You possess all project data on your local machine and can delete it at any time.

Key Management: You maintain full control over your API keys within the Software's settings.

5. GOVERNING LAW
This Privacy Policy and your use of the Software are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising from this policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.
