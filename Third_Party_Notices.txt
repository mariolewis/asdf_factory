SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS & DISCLOSURES
1. Brand and Name Ownership
The name "Klyve," the Klyve logo, and all associated branding elements are the exclusive intellectual property of Mario Joseph Lewis. While this license grants you the right to use and modify the source code, it does not grant permission to use the "Klyve" name or branding for any derivative works, redistributed versions, or commercial offerings. Any modified version of this software must be clearly rebranded under a different name.   

2. Third-Party Dependencies & Credits
Klyve includes various third-party open-source components (e.g., PySide6/Qt, Shiboken6). These components are governed by their own respective licenses (such as LGPLv3). Full license texts and obligatory credits are available in the "About Klyve" menu and the root installation directory. Your use of this Software constitutes acceptance of these third-party terms.   

3. AI Transparency (EU AI Act Article 50)
Klyve functions as an autonomous software development factory using generative AI.   


Synthetic Generation: Code and architectural specifications produced are synthetically generated and not by a human.   


Marking: The Developer reserves the right to embed machine-readable metadata within generated files to identify them as AI-synthesized for regulatory compliance.   

4. User Responsibility
As an open-source tool for developers, you act as the "Human-in-the-Loop". You bear sole responsibility for reviewing, auditing, and testing all generated code before deployment. The Developer assumes no liability for damage resulting from the use of the Software.

Local Processing: All generation and logic processing occur locally on your machine.   


Direct Connection: AI features connect directly from your machine to your chosen AI provider using your own API keys. Data does not pass through any server owned by the Developer.   

2. DATA TRANSMISSION TO AI PROVIDERS
To function, the Software transmits project-related snippets and logs to the third-party Large Language Model (LLM) provider configured in your settings.   


Training: The Developer does not access your data and cannot use it to train proprietary models.   


Third-Party Policies: Whether your data is used for training by the LLM provider depends on your separate agreement and API tier with that provider.
