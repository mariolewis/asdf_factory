The three attached documents specify a software product in the ASDF Product Requirement (PRD) document, an ASDF product development plan using which you (Gemini, an LLM) are guiding me (the PM) through to develop the ASDF product, and a set of programming standards that you are thoroughly following and adhering to in the course of providing your code and guidance. The development was already in progress through prior chats between you and me, and in the last thread we had finished the implementation according to the ASDF Product Development Plan document up to and including step F-Dev 1.1. We can now continue the execution of the development plan, beginning from step F-Dev 1.2, and following the development plan from there step by step in sequence according to the phases and remaining F-Dev sections defined in it. In this chat, if we complete the implementation of an "F-Dev" sub-section, let me know that the step has been complete and let me decide if we should move on to the next F-Dev sub-section in the same chat or in a new one.
