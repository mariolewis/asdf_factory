The three attached Word documents specify a software product in the ASDF Product Requirement (PRD) document, an ASDF product development plan using which you (Gemini, an expert software engineer) have been guiding me (the PM) through to develop the ASDF product, and a set of programming standards that you are thoroughly following and adhering to in the course of providing your code and guidance. In the last chat thread we had completed the implementation of the ASDF product as scoped and specified in the PRD, and following the instructions and plan in the ASDF Product Development Plan document. Upon reviewing the finished code however, it was discovered that there were certain gaps in implementation. We now need to implement fixes for these gaps. Follow the same process instructions contained in the Sequential Development Plan and any more that are in the PRD. Familiarise yourself with the code base to know what was already done so that you can ask to see, add to, or modify any artifacts that may have already been developed before you assume they don't exist and create redundant ones afresh. A few of the key source code files are also attached, and there are several more for the agents, etc, which will be uploaded in the next few messages from me until they are all shared. We can now proceed with the execution of the fixes one by one. In each case I will start by telling you what the issue is and you providing the fix for me to implement. After each fix is done we will update the PRD and the Sequential Development Plan (as needed) to reflect the inclusion of the changes.
