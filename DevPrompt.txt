The three attached Word documents specify a software product in the ASDF Product Requirement (PRD) document, an ASDF product development plan using which you (Gemini, an expert software engineer) have been guiding me (the PM) through to develop the ASDF product, and a set of programming standards that you are thoroughly following and adhering to in the course of providing your code and guidance. There's also a document containing a register of 7 change request specifications, each identified by a change request number. In the last chat thread we had completed the implementation of the ASDF product as scoped and specified in the PRD, and following the instructions and plan in the ASDF Product Development Plan document. We now need to implement the specified change requests in the sequence that is defined near the beginning of the change request document. Follow the same instructions contained in the Sequential Development Plan and any more that are in the PRD. Familiarise yourself with the code base to know what was already done so that you can ask to see, add to, or modify any artifacts that may have already been developed before you assume they don't exist and create redundant ones afresh. A few of the key source code files are also attached, and there are several more for the agents, etc, which will be uploaded in the very next messages from me until they are all shared. We can now proceed with the execution of the change requests one by one, starting with CR-004, and follow the sequence from there step by step until all 7 are done. After that we will update the PRD and the Sequential Development Plan to reflect the inclusion of the changes.
