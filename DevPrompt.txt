The three attached documents specify a software product in the ASDF Product Requirement (PRD) document, an ASDF product development plan using which you (Gemini, an expert software engineer) are guiding me (the PM) through to develop the ASDF product, and a set of programming standards that you are thoroughly following and adhering to in the course of providing your code and guidance. The development was already in progress through prior chats between you and me, starting from Phase F-Dev 0 onwards, and in the last chat thread we had completed the implementation (according to the ASDF Product Development Plan document) of Phase F-Dev 2, up to and including step F-Dev 2.3. Familiarise yourself (from the development plan) with what was already done so that you can ask to see, add to, or modify any artifacts that may have already been developed before you assume they don't exist and create redundant ones afresh. We can now continue the execution of the development plan, starting from step F-Dev 3.1 of Phase F-Dev 3, and follow the development plan from there step by step in the sequence specified for the remaining F-Dev subsections defined in that phase. 


An addition to be made once 3.4 is done is to change the environment setup agent to add the development of a build script once the technology stack is know. First the PRD should be updated. Then the Dev Plan needs to be updated. 

How does the PM feedback test failures after he does any tests via the ASDF GUI outside of the ASDF?
