# Klyve

> Klyve is a free, local-first SDLC orchestrator. You manage the architecture, backlog, and sprints; Klyve forces the AI to execute code, tests, and documentation. It turns any LLM (Cloud, Local, or Corporate) into a disciplined software team to build complete applications.

## About Klyve
Klyve solves the "context drift" problem inherent in AI coding agents. Instead of relying on an open-ended chat interface, Klyve wraps the LLM in a structured methodology. It maintains a permanent "Project Memory" locally and feeds the LLM only the specific constraints needed for the current task. This allows a single developer to act as the Senior Partner, orchestrating the full software development lifecycle for both greenfield projects and brownfield maintenance.
